# Sol Cart
Sol Cart is a revolutionary technology that propose to combine mobile dApp, autonomous robotic shopping cart and Solana Saga smartphone to create the triangle of an intelligent and Solana-powered retail ecosystem.

This tech solve the bad shoppers' experience in conventional shopping that used tradiotional shopping cart and counter payment method. Even when tech is rising up so quickly, the existing retails services for shoppers are lagging behind.








DEMO:

We foresee the Solana Saga Phone as a key enabler to a seamless shopping experience using our app through Solana-enabled payments. We incentivise shopping by airdropping vouchers in the form of NFTs and loyalty points in the form of tokens to reward loyal and frequent shoppers. 

Our App links with the robot cart. Simply scan the barcode on the cart to log in to your profile which keeps track of all your shopping lists and transactions. Our app also allows you to check if the product is ethically sourced through supply chain tracking.

When the user presses the guide button, they need to choose the product category they wish to find and then the cart will automatically navigate to the desired location, this feature helps users to experience an efficient way of finding their desired item. Then, when the user presses the follow button, this cart will follow everywhere the user goes while shopping.
This cart also can scan the product’s barcode to total up the final price to be checked out later.
Moreover, the cart’s autonomous capabilities enable it to guide and follow users, this eliminates the challenges that users often face while shopping. Furthermore, this cart empowers individuals with disabilities to enjoy more inclusive & stress-free shopping experiences.

Shoppers can self-checkout and pay by scanning QR only, which integrates Solana Pay. This links to Phantom Wallet which will be used to approve the purchase. Loyal shoppers will be airdrop NFT badges that also serve as discount vouchers on their next purchase. 

Solana Cart serves as a platform for merchants to optimise customer lifetime value, and for customers to hunt for the best deals on their shopping.
